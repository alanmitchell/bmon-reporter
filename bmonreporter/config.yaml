# These are the GitHub repositories that are looped through to determine the BMON
# servers to scan and the Jupyter Notebook reports to run.  Each GitHub repo contains
# the Jupyter Notebook templates that produce the energy reports and contain a
# configuration file that determines what BMON servers to apply the reports to.
# If the "branch" key is not present for a repo, the "master" branch is used.
